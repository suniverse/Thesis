@article{komissarov_electrodynamics_2004,
	Abstract = {The main goal of this research is to get better insights into the properties of the plasma-filled magnetospheres of black holes by means of direct numerical simulations and, ultimately, to resolve the controversy surrounding the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. Driven by the need to write the equations of black hole electrodynamics in a form convenient for numerical applications, we constructed a new system of 3 + 1 equations, which not only has a more traditional form than the now classic 3 + 1 system of Thorne and Macdonald but also is more general. To deal with the magnetospheric current sheets, we also developed a simple model of radiative resistivity based on the inverse Compton scattering of background photons. The results of numerical simulations combined with simple analytical arguments allow us to make a number of important conclusions on the nature of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. We show that, just like in the Penrose mechanism and in the magnetohydrodynamic models of Punsly and Coroniti, the key role in this mechanism is played by the black hole ergosphere. The poloidal currents are driven by the gravitationally induced electric field, which cannot be screened within the ergosphere by any static distribution of the electric charge of locally created pair plasma. Contrary to what is expected in the membrane paradigm, the energy and angular momentum are extracted not only along the magnetic field lines penetrating the event horizon but also along all field lines penetrating the ergosphere. In dipolar magnetic configurations symmetric relative to the equatorial plane, the force-free approximation breaks down within the ergosphere, where a strong current sheet develops along the equatorial plane. This current sheet supplies energy and angular momentum at infinity to the surrounding force-free magnetosphere. The Blandford-Znajek monopole solution is found to be asymptotically stable and causal. The so-called horizon boundary condition of Znajek is shown to be a regularity condition at fast critical surface.},

By using the relativistic ``particle-in-cell'' method with special boundary conditions to represent plasma dynamics in 3D, we are able to follow magnetospheric plasma through the light cylinder into the wind zone for arbitrary magnetic inclination angles. For aligned rotators we confirm the ``disk-dome'' charge-separated structure of the magnetosphere and find that this configuration is unstable to a 3D non-axisymmetric diocotron instability. This instability allows plasma to move across the field lines and approach the corotating Goldreich-Julian solution within several rotation periods. For oblique rotators formation of the spiral ``striped wind'' in the equatorial direction is demonstrated and the acceleration of the wind and its magnetization is discussed. We find that the wind properties vary with stellar latitude; however, whether injection conditions at the pulsar are responsible for the observed jet-equator geometry of the Crab and Vela pulsars is currently under investigation. We also comment on the electrodynamics of the simulated magnetospheres, their current closure, and future simulations.},

@article{muslimov_extended_2003,
	Abstract = {We revise the physics of primary electron acceleration in the ``slot gap'' (SG) above the pulsar polar caps (PCs), a regime originally proposed by Arons \& Scharlemann in their electrodynamic model of pulsar PCs. We employ the standard definition of the SG as a pair-free space between the last open field lines and the boundary of the pair plasma column that is expected to develop above the bulk of the PC. The rationale for our revision is that the proper treatment of primary acceleration within the pulsar SGs should take into account the effect of the narrow geometry of the gap on the electrodynamics within the gap and also include the effect of inertial frame dragging on the particle acceleration. We show that the accelerating electric field within the gap, being significantly boosted by the effect of frame dragging, becomes reduced because of the gap geometry by a factor proportional to the square of the SG width. The combination of the effects of frame dragging and geometrical screening in the gap region naturally gives rise to a regime of extended acceleration, which is not limited to ``favorably curved'' field lines as in earlier models, and the
possibility of multiple-pair production by curvature photons at very high altitudes, up to several stellar radii. We present our estimates of the characteristic SG thickness across the PC, energetics of primaries accelerated within the gap, high-energy bolometric luminosities emitted from the high altitudes in the gaps, and maximum heating luminosities produced by positrons returning from the elevated pair fronts. The estimated theoretical high-energy luminosities are in good agreement with the corresponding empirical relationships for gamma-ray pulsars. We illustrate the results of our modeling of the pair cascades and gamma-ray emission from the high altitudes in the SG for the Crab pulsar. The combination of the frame-dragging field and high-altitude SG emission enables both acceleration at the smaller inclination angles and a larger emission beam, both necessary to produce widely spaced
double-peaked profiles.},

@article{thompson_soft_1995,
	Abstract = {A radiative model for the soft gamma repeaters and the energetic 1979
March 5 burst is presented. We identify the sources of these bursts with
neutron stars the external magnetic fields of which are much stronger
than those of ordinary pulsars. Several independent arguments point to a
neutron star with B\_dipole{\textasciitilde}5x10{\textasciicircum}14 G as the source of the March 5 event.
A very strong field can (i) spin down the star to an 8-s period in the
{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}4-yr age of the surrounding supernova remnant N49; (ii) provide
enough energy for the March 5 event; (iii) undergo a large-scale
interchange instability the growth time of which is comparable to the
{\textasciitilde}0.2-s width of the initial hard transient phase of the March 5 event;
(iv) confine the energy that was radiated in the soft tail of that
burst; (v) reduce the Compton scattering cross-section sufficiently to
generate a radiative flux that is {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}4 times the (non-magnetic)
Eddington flux; (vi) decay significantly in {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}4-10{\textasciicircum}5 yr, as is
required to explain the activity of soft gamma repeater sources on this
time-scale; and (vii) power the quiescent X-ray emission L\_X{\textasciitilde}7x10{\textasciicircum}35 erg
s{\textasciicircum}-1 observed by Einstein and ROSAT as it diffuses the stellar interior.
We propose that the 1979 March 5 event was triggered by a large-scale
reconnection/interchange instability of the stellar magnetic field, and
the soft repeat bursts by cracking of the crust. The hard initial spike
of the March 5 event is identified with an expanding pair fireball, and
the soft tail of that burst, together with the short, soft repeat
bursts, with a pair plasma trapped in the stellar magnetosphere. We
construct a detailed radiative model that describes the cooling of such
a plasma. The opacity is dominated by the electron-baryon contaminant in
a cold surface layer, and the plasma releases energy as the edge of the
pair-dominated region propagates inward, in a cooling wave. The rate at
which the plasma volume contracts is limited either by the rate of
advection of heat toward the stellar surface (where the field is
strongest and the scattering opacity weakest), or by ablation of ions
and electrons from the stellar surface. The effective temperature of the
surface radiation depends only on the surface magnetic field strength in
the regime where the radiative flux is limited by ablation from the
neutron star surface (which is the regime of interest in the March 5
event), and otherwise is weakly dependent on the plasma energy density.
We argue that the deposition of equivalent energy in a much weaker
magnetic field (characteristic of ordinary pulsars) necessarily
generates a very high scattering depth which chokes off the radiative
flow on the observed {\textasciitilde}0.1-s time-scale of soft gamma repeater bursts.
Indeed, we suggest that the same basic magnetospheric emission mechanism
operates at lower field strengths (B{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}12 G) in Type II X-ray bursts,
which have much lower luminosities than soft gamma repeater bursts.
Important magnetic radiative effects include the suppression of Compton
scattering in the extraordinary polarization mode, and stimulated photon
splitting. We derive the Boltzmann equations for the photon occupation
number which describe simulated photon splitting, as well as photon
merging. We show that the net splitting rate vanishes in thermal
equilibrium. Radiative diffusion occurs primarily in the E-mode,
although rapid scattering of the O-mode ensures convergence of the
photon distribution function to a Bose-Einstein form. This allows us to
write down diffusion equations for the photon energy flux and number
flux as linear superpositions of gradients in the temperature and
chemical potential. The transition from a Planck to a Bose-Einstein
spectrum occurs at T{\textasciitilde}10 keV. Photon splitting at higher temperatures can
impede free-streaming of photons across the magnetic field lines, but
splitting of high-energy photons is impeded by the inverse process of
photon merging. We demonstrate that only a small fraction of the pair
bubble energy can be conducted into the crust during the lifetime of the
burst. We discuss the radiative ablation of matter from the heated
stellar surface after the magnetospheric pair plasma is dissipated. The
ensuing surface afterglow is typically {\textasciitilde}1 per cent of the burst
luminosity. Direct pair neutrino cooling of the plasma is shown to be
unimportant for soft gamma repeater bursts, but may help to determine
the light curve of the March 5 event. Finally, we make a critical
comparison between this model and models in which the soft gamma
repeater bursts are triggered by accretion and/or involve surface
cooling.},

We restrict ourselves to the regions where the proper frequency of cyclotron resonance greatly exceeds the proper frequencies of the radiative normal modes. The normal modes are derived when the plasma has no momentum dispersion across the magnetic field but has arbitrary momentum dispersion along the field. The contribution of displacement current to the propagation of these "hydromagnetic" waves is consistently included. The distinction between superluminous and subluminous modes is made in the superstrong regime, where drift motions across the field are negligible, and useful formulae for the Landau damping of the subluminous branch of ordinary mode (the Alfven wave) are derived. These are used to set observational constraints on the geometry of the emission zone in radio pulsars, if the emission mechanism generates radiation in the form of subluminous waves. A brief discussion is given of the relevance of nonvacuum propagation to Razin suppression of bunched coherent curvature emission.},

	Abstract = {We present {\textquotedblleft}first-principles{\textquotedblright} relativistic particle-in-cell
simulations of the oblique pulsar magnetosphere with pair formation. The
magnetosphere starts to form with particles extracted from the surface
of the neutron star. These particles are accelerated by surface electric
fields and emit photons capable of producing electron-positron
pairs. We inject secondary pairs at the locations of primary energetic
particles whose energy exceeds the threshold for pair formation. We find
solutions that are close to the ideal force-free magnetosphere with the
Y-point and current sheet. Solutions with obliquities <=40{\textdegree} do not
show pair production in the open field line region because the local
current density along the magnetic field is below the
Goldreich-Julian value. The bulk outflow in these solutions is
charge-separated, and pair formation happens in the current sheet and
return current layer only. Solutions with higher inclinations show pair
production in the open field line region, with high multiplicity of the
bulk flow and the size of the pair-producing region increasing with
inclination. We observe the spin-down of the star to be comparable to
MHD model predictions. The magnetic dissipation in the current sheet
ranges between 20\% for the aligned rotator and 3\% for the orthogonal
rotator. Our results suggest that for low obliquity neutron stars with
suppressed pair formation at the light cylinder, the presence of
phenomena related to pair activity in the bulk of the polar region,
e.g., radio emission, may crucially depend on the physics beyond our
simplified model, such as the effects of curved spacetime or multipolar
surface fields.},

	Abstract = {Neutron stars with unusually strong magnetic dipole fields  B\_dipole {\textasciitilde}
10{\textasciicircum}14 - 10{\textasciicircum}15 G, can form when conditions for efficient helical dynamo
action are met during the first few seconds after gravitational
collapse.  Such high-field neutron stars, "magnetars," initially rotate
with short periods {\textasciitilde} 1 ms, but quickly lose most of their rotational
energy via magnetic braking, giving a large energy boost to the
associated supernova explosion.  Several mechanisms unique to magnetars
can plausibly generate large ({\textasciitilde} 1000 km/s) recoil velocities.  These
include anisotropic neutrino emission, core rotational instability and
fragmentation, and/or anisotropic magnetic winds.

Magnetars are relatively difficult to detect because they drop below the
radio death line faster than ordinary pulsars, and because they probably
do not remain bound in binary systems.  We conjecture that their main
observational signature is gamma-ray bursts powered by their vast
reservoirs of magnetic energy.  If they acquire large recoils, most
magnetars are unbound from the Galaxy or reside in an extended, weakly
bound Galactic corona.  There is evidence that the soft gamma repeaters
are young magnetars.

Finally, we note that a convective dynamo can also generate a very
strong dipole field after the merger of a neutron star binary, but only
if the merged star survives for as long as {\textasciitilde} 10-100 ms.},

	Abstract = {Very rapidly spinning magnetized neutron stars such as the Crab and Vela pulsars are strong $\gamma$-ray sources with photon energies extending to 1012eV and possibly beyond. These special pulsars must contain extremely ultrarelativistic particle accelerators. In this paper the authors consider the origin and structure of particle accelerators in the outer magnetosphere of pulsars characterized by large spindown energy loss rates. The discussion is concerned with the class of (mainly young) pulsars which can sustain pair production in otherwise charge-depleted regions of the outer magnetosphere. The resulting electrostatic accelerating region ("gap") is expected to exist far from the neutron star, where a corotating magnetosphere would be rotating at speeds a significant fraction of c. The size and location of this gap supports the production of energetic radiation beams of quite different character from the usual coherent microwave emission of radio pulsars.},

@article{mikic_disruption_1994,
	Abstract = {The ideal and resistive properties of isolated large-scale coronal magnetic arcades are studied using axisymmetric solutions of the time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in spherical
geometry. We examine how flares and coronal mass ejections may be initiated by sudden disruptions of the magnetic field. The evolution of coronal arcades in response to applied shearing photospheric flows indicates that disruptive behavior can occur beyond a critical shear. The disruption can be traced to ideal MHD magnetic nonequilibrium. The magnetic field expands outward in a process that opens the field lines and produces a tangential discontinuity in the magnetic field. In the presence of plasma resistivity, the resulting current sheet is the site of rapid reconnection, leading to an impulsive release of magnetic energy, fast flows, and the ejection of a plasmoid. We relate these results to previous studies of force-free fields and to the properties of the open-field configuration. We show that the field lines in an arcade are forced open when the magnetic energy approaches (but is still below) the open-field energy, creating a partially open field in which most of the field lines extend away from the solar surface. Preliminary application of this model to helmet streamers indicates that it is relevant to the initiation of coronal mass ejections.},

	Abstract = {We report on a 350 ks NuSTAR observation of the magnetar 1E 1841-045 taken in 2013 September. During the observation, NuSTAR detected six bursts of short duration, with T90 ? 1 s. An elevated level of emission tail is detected after the brightest burst, persisting for \~{}1 ks. The emission showed a power-law decay with a temporal index of 0.5 before returning to the persistent emission level. The long observation also provided detailed phase-resolved spectra of the persistent X-ray emission of the source. By comparing the persistent spectrum with that previously reported, we find that the source hard-band emission has been stable for over approximately 10 yr. The persistent hard-X-ray emission is well fitted by a coronal outflow model, where e{\textpm} pairs in the magnetosphere upscatter
thermal X-rays. Our fit of phase-resolved spectra allowed us to estimate the angle between the rotational and magnetic dipole axes of the magnetar, \{$\alpha$ \}\{mag\}=0.25, the twisted magnetic flux,
2.5 {\texttimes} 1026 G cm2, and the power released in the twisted magnetosphere, \{L\}j = 6 {\texttimes} 1036 erg s-1. Assuming this model for the hard-X-ray
spectrum, the soft-X-ray component is well fit by a two-blackbody model, with the hotter blackbody consistent with the footprint of the twisted magnetic field lines on the star. We also report on the 3 yr Swift monitoring observations obtained since 2011 July. The soft-X-ray spectrum remained stable during this period, and the timing behavior was noisy, with large timing residuals.},

@article{ibrahim_discovery_2004,
	Abstract = {We report the discovery of a new X-ray pulsar, XTE J1810-197, that was serendipitously discovered on 2003 July 15 by the Rossi X- Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) while observing the soft gamma repeater SGR 1806-20. The pulsar has a 5.54 s spin period, a soft X-ray spectrum (with a photon index of {\textasciitilde}4), and is detectable in earlier RXTE observations back to 2003 January but not before. These show that a transient outburst began between 2002 November 17 and 2003 January 23 and that the source's persistent X-ray flux has been declining since then. The pulsar exhibits a high spin-down rate P{\textasciitilde}10-11 s s-1 with no evidence of Doppler shifts due to a binary companion. The rapid
spin-down rate and slow spin period imply a supercritical characteristic magnetic field B{\textasciitilde}=3{\texttimes}1014 G and a young age
$\tau${\textless}=7600 yr. Follow-up Chandra observations provided an accurate
position of the source. Within its error radius, the 1.5 m
Russian-Turkish Optical Telescope found a limiting magnitude
RC=21.5. All such properties are strikingly similar to those of anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft gamma repeaters, providing strong evidence that the source is a new magnetar. However, archival ASCA and ROSAT observations found the source nearly 2 orders of magnitude fainter. This transient behavior and the observed long-term flux variability of the source in absence of an observed SGR-like burst activity make it the first confirmed transient magnetar and suggest that other neutron stars that share the properties of XTE J1810-197 during its inactive phase may be unidentified transient magnetars awaiting detection via a similar activity. This implies a larger population of magnetars than previously surmised and a possible evolutionary
connection between magnetars and other neutron star families.},

@article{cerutti_particle_2015,
	Abstract = {The equatorial current sheet in pulsar magnetospheres is often regarded as an ideal site for particle acceleration via relativistic
reconnection. Using 2D spherical particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate particle acceleration in the axisymmetric pulsar
magnetosphere as a function of the injected plasma multiplicity and magnetization. We observe a clear transition from a highly
charge-separated magnetosphere for low plasma injection with little current and spin-down power, to a nearly force-free solution for high plasma multiplicity characterized by a prominent equatorial current sheet and high spin-down power. We find significant magnetic dissipation in the current sheet, up to 30 per cent within 5 light-cylinder radii in the high-multiplicity regime. The simulations unambiguously demonstrate that the dissipated Poynting flux is efficiently channelled to the particles in the sheet, close to the Y-point within about 1-2
light-cylinder radii from the star. The mean particle energy in the sheet is given by the upstream plasma magnetization at the light cylinder. The study of particle orbits shows that all energetic
particles originate from the boundary layer between the open and the closed field lines. Energetic positrons always stream outwards, while high-energy electrons precipitate back towards the star through the sheet and along the separatrices, which may result in auroral-like emission. Our results suggest that the current sheet and the
separatrices may be the main source of high-energy radiation in young pulsars.},

@article{beloborodov_corona_2007,
	Abstract = {We develop a theoretical model that explains the formation of hot coronae around strongly magnetized neutron stars-magnetars. The starquakes of a magnetar shear its external magnetic field, which becomes nonpotential and threaded by an electric current. Once twisted, the magnetosphere cannot untwist immediately because of its self-induction. The self-induction electric field lifts particles from the stellar surface, accelerates them, and initiates avalanches of pair creation in the magnetosphere. The created plasma corona maintains the electric current demanded by b.nabla XB and regulates the self-induction EMF by screening. This corona persists in dynamic equilibrium: it is continually lost to the stellar surface on the light crossing time {\textasciitilde}10-4 s and replenished with new particles. In essence, the twisted magnetosphere acts as an accelerator that converts the toroidal field energy to particle kinetic energy. Using a direct numerical experiment, we show that the corona self-organizes quickly (on a millisecond timescale) into a quasi-steady state, with voltage 108-109 V along the magnetic lines. The voltage is maintained near the threshold for e+/- discharge. The heating rate of the corona is {\textasciitilde}1036 ergs s-1, in agreement with the observed persistent, high-energy output of magnetars. We deduce that a static twist that is suddenly implanted into the magnetosphere will decay on a timescale of 1-10 yr. The particles accelerated in the corona impact the solid crust, knock out protons, and regulate the column density of the hydrostatic atmosphere of the star. The transition layer between the atmosphere and corona may be hot enough to create additional e+/- pairs. This layer can be the source of the observed 100 keV emission from magnetars. The corona emits curvature radiation and can supply the observed IR-optical luminosity.},

@article{thompson_giant_2001,
	Abstract = {The extraordinary 1998 August 27 giant flare places strong constraints
on the physical properties of its source, SGR 1900+14. We make detailed
comparisons of the published data with the magnetar model, which
identifies the soft gamma repeaters as neutron stars endowed with
{\textasciitilde}1015 G magnetic fields. The giant flare evolved through
three stages, whose radiative mechanisms we address in turn. The extreme
peak luminosity L{\textgreater}106LEdd, hard spectrum, and
rapid variability of the initial {\textasciitilde}0.5 s spike emission all point to an
expanding pair fireball with very low baryon contamination. We argue
that this energy must have been deposited directly through shearing and
reconnection of a magnetar-strength external magnetic field. Low-order
torsional oscillations of the star fail to transmit energy rapidly
enough to the exterior, if the surface field is much weaker. A
triggering mechanism is proposed, whereby a helical distortion of the
core magnetic field induces large-scale fracturing in the crust and a
twisting deformation of the crust and exterior magnetic field. After the
initial spike (whose {\textasciitilde}0.4 s duration can be related to the Alfv{\'e}n
crossing time of the core), very hot (T{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1 MeV) plasma rich in
electron-positron pairs remains confined close to the star on closed
magnetic field lines. The envelope of the August 27 flare can be
accurately fitted, after {\textasciitilde}40 s, by the contracting surface of such a
``trapped fireball.'' The form of this fit gives evidence that the
temperature of the trapped pair plasma decreases outward from its
center. We quantify the effects of direct neutrino pair emission on the
X-ray light curve, thereby deducing a lower bound
$\mu$min{\textasciitilde}1{\texttimes}1032 G cm3 to the
magnetic moment of the confining field, comparable to the strongest
fields measured in radio pulsars. The radiative flux during the
intermediate {\textasciitilde}40 s of the burst appears to exceed the trapped fireball
fit. The lack of strong rotational modulation and intermediate hardness
of this smooth tail are consistent with the emission from an extended
pair corona, in which O-mode photons are heated by Compton scattering.
This feature could represent residual seismic activity within the star
and accounts for {\textasciitilde}10\% of the total flare fluence. We consider in detail
the critical luminosity, below which a stable balance can be maintained
between heating and radiative cooling in a confined, magnetized pair
plasma, but above which the confined plasma runs away to a trapped
fireball in LTE. The emergence of large-amplitude pulsations at {\textasciitilde}40 s
probably represents a transition to a pair-depleted photosphere whose
main source of opacity is electrons (and ions) ablated from the heated
neutron star surface. The best-fit temperature of the blackbody
component of the spectrum equilibrates at a value that agrees well with
the regulating effect of photon splitting. The remarkable four-peaked
substructure within each 5.16 s pulse, as well as the corresponding
collimation of the X-ray flux, has a simple explanation based on the
strong inequality between the scattering cross sections of the two
photon polarization modes. The width of each X-ray ``jet'' is directly
related to the amount of matter advected outward by the high cross
section ordinary mode.},

	Abstract = {We explore the pulsar slot gap (SG) electrodynamics up to very high altitudes, where for most relatively rapidly rotating pulsars both the standard small-angle approximation and the assumption that the magnetic field lines are ideal streamlines break down. We address the importance of the electrodynamic conditions at the SG boundaries and the occurrence of a steady state drift of charged particles across the SG field lines at very high altitudes. These boundary conditions and the deviation of particle trajectories from streamlines determine the asymptotic behavior of the scalar potential at all radii from the polar cap (PC) to near the light cylinder. As a result, we demonstrate that the steady state accelerating electric field, E{\textbar}{\textbar}, must approach a small and constant value at high altitude above the PC. This E{\textbar}{\textbar} is capable of maintaining electrons moving with high Lorentz factors ({\textasciitilde}few{\texttimes}107) and emitting curvature gamma-ray photons
up to nearly the light cylinder. By numerical simulations, we show that primary electrons accelerating from the PC surface to high altitude in the SG along the outer edge of the open field region will form caustic emission patterns on the trailing dipole field lines. Acceleration and emission in such an extended SG may form the physical basis of a model that can successfully reproduce some pulsar high-energy light curves.},

Our data were obtained simultaneously with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and Swift, and cover the energy range from 0.5-79 keV. We present pulse profiles in various energy bands and compare them to previous RXTE results. The NuSTAR data show pulsations above 20 keV for the first time and we report evidence that one of the pulses in the double-peaked pulse profile shifts position with energy. The pulsed fraction of the magnetar is shown to increase strongly with energy. Our spectral analysis reveals that the soft X-ray spectrum is well characterized by an absorbed double blackbody or blackbody plus power-law model in agreement with previous reports. Our new hard X-ray data, however, suggest that an additional component, such as a power law, is needed to describe the NuSTAR and Swift spectrum. We also fit the data with the recently developed coronal outflow model by
Beloborodov for hard X-ray emission from magnetars. The outflow from a ring on the magnetar surface is statistically preferred over outflow from a polar cap.},

@article{parfrey_dynamics_2013,
	Abstract = {Magnetar magnetospheres are believed to be strongly twisted, due to shearing of the stellar crust by internal magnetic stresses. We present time-dependent axisymmetric simulations showing in detail the evolution of relativistic force-free magnetospheres subjected to slow twisting through large angles. When the twist amplitude is small, the magnetosphere moves quasi-statically through a sequence of equilibria of increasing free energy. At some twist amplitude the magnetosphere becomes tearing-mode unstable to forming a resistive current sheet, initiating large-scale magnetic reconnection in which a significant fraction of the magnetic free energy can be dissipated. This "critical" twist angle is insensitive to the resistive length scale. Rapid shearing temporarily stabilizes the magnetosphere beyond the critical angle, allowing the magnetosphere of a rapidly differentially rotating star to store, and dissipate, more free energy. In addition to these effects, shearing the surface of a rotating star increases the spindown torque applied to the star. If shearing is much slower than rotation, the resulting spikes in spindown rate can occur on timescales anywhere from the long twisting timescale to the stellar spin period or shorter, depending both on the stellar shear distribution and the existing distribution of magnetospheric twists. A model in which energy is stored in the magnetosphere, and released by a magnetospheric instability, therefore predicts large changes in the measured spindown rate before SGR giant flares.},

@article{timokhin_current_2013,
	Abstract = {We report the results of an investigation of particle acceleration and electron-positron plasma generation at low altitude in the polar magnetic flux tubes of rotation-powered pulsars, when the stellar surface is free to emit whatever charges and currents are demanded by the force-free magnetosphere. We apply a new 1D hybrid plasma simulation code to the dynamical problem, using Particle-in-Cell methods for the dynamics of the charged particles, including a determination of the collective electrostatic fluctuations in the plasma, combined with a Monte Carlo treatment of the high-energy gamma-rays that mediate the formation of the electron-positron pairs. We assume the electric current flowing through the pair creation zone is fixed by the much higher inductance magnetosphere, and adopt the results of force-free magnetosphere models to provide the currents which must be carried by the accelerator. The models are spatially one dimensional, and designed to explore the physics, although of practical relevance to young, high-voltage pulsars. We observe novel behaviour (a) When the current density j is less than the Goldreich-Julian value (0 {\textless} j/jGJ {\textless} 1), space charge limited acceleration of the current carrying beam is mild, with the full Goldreich-Julian charge density comprising the charge densities of the beam and a cloud of electrically trapped particles with the same sign of charge as the beam. The voltage drops are of the order of mc2/e, and pair creation is absent. (b) When the current density exceeds the Goldreich-Julian value (j/jGJ {\textgreater} 1), the system develops high voltage drops (TV or greater), causing emission of curvature gamma-rays and intense bursts of pair creation. The bursts exhibit limit cycle behaviour, with characteristic time-scales somewhat longer than the relativistic fly-by time over distances comparable to the polar cap diameter (microseconds). (c) In return current regions, where j/jGJ {\textless} 0, the system develops similar bursts of pair creation. These discharges are similar to those encountered in previous calculations by Timokhin of pair creation when the surface has a high work function and cannot freely emit charge. In cases (b) and (c), the intermittently generated pairs allow the system to simultaneously carry the magnetospherically prescribed currents and adjust the charge density and average electric field to force-free conditions. We also elucidate the conditions for pair creating beam flow to be steady (stationary with small fluctuations in the rotating frame), finding that such steady flows can occupy only a small fraction of the current density parameter space exhibited by the force-free magnetospheric model. The generic polar flow dynamics and pair creation are strongly time dependent. The model has an essential difference from almost all previous quantitative studies, in that we sought the accelerating voltage (with pair creation, when the voltage drops are sufficiently large; without, when they are small) as a function of the applied current. The 1D results described here characterize the dependence of acceleration and pair creation on the magnitude and sign of current. The dependence on the spatial distribution of the current is a multi-dimensional problem, possibly exhibiting more chaotic behaviour. We briefly outline possible relations of the electric field fluctuations observed in the polar flows (both with and without pair creation discharges) to direct emission of radio waves, as well as revive the possible relation of the observed limit cycle behaviour to microstructure in the radio emission. Actually modelling these effects requires the multi-dimensional treatment, to be reported in a later paper.},

@article{thompson_electrodynamics_2002,
	Abstract = {We consider the structure of neutron star magnetospheres threaded by
large-scale electrical currents and the effect of resonant Compton
scattering by the charge carriers (both electrons and ions) on the
emergent X-ray spectra and pulse profiles. In the magnetar model for the
soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs), these
currents are maintained by magnetic stresses acting deep inside the
star, which generate both sudden disruptions (SGR outbursts) and more
gradual plastic deformations of the rigid crust. We construct
self-similar force-free equilibria of the current-carrying magnetosphere
with a power-law dependence of magnetic field on radius,
B{\textasciitilde}r-(2+p), and show that a large-scale twist of field lines
softens the radial dependence of the magnetic field to p{\textless}1. The
spin-down torque acting on the star is thereby increased in comparison
with an orthogonal vacuum dipole. We comment on the strength of the
surface magnetic field in the SGR and AXP sources, as inferred from
their measured spin-down rates, and the implications of this model for
the narrow measured distribution of spin periods. A magnetosphere with a
strong twist [B$\varphi$/B$\theta$=O(1) at the
equator] has an optical depth {\textasciitilde}1 to resonant cyclotron scattering,
independent of frequency (radius), surface magnetic field strength, or
charge/mass ratio of the scattering charge. When electrons and ions
supply the current, the stellar surface is also heated by the impacting
charges at a rate comparable to the observed X-ray output of the SGR and
AXP sources, if Bdipole{\textasciitilde}1014 G. Redistribution of
the emerging X-ray flux at the cyclotron resonance will strongly modify
the emerging pulse profile and, through the Doppler effect, generate a
nonthermal tail to the X-ray spectrum. We relate the sudden change in
the pulse profile of SGR 1900+14 following the 1998 August 27 giant
flare to an enhanced optical depth at the electron cyclotron resonance
resulting from a sudden twist imparted to the external magnetic field
during the flare. The self-similar structure of the magnetosphere should
generate frequency-independent profiles; more complicated pulse profiles
may reflect the presence of higher multipoles, ion cyclotron scattering,
or possibly nonresonant Compton scattering of O-mode photons by
pair-loaded currents.},

	Abstract = {I summarize the status of pulsar theory, now 35 years after their discovery. Although progress has been made in understanding the relevant processes involved, there are several widely held misconceptions that are inhibiting further advances. These include the idea that plasma ``must'' be accelerated from the magnetic polar caps (the basis for the ``Hollow Cone Model'') and the idea that winds would be driven away by centrifugal forces, with large amplitude electromagnetic waves playing no role whatsoever. However, recent theoretical work is converging on a picture that closely resembles the latest HST and Chandra images, providing hope for the future. No less than three groups have recently confirmed the early Krause-Polstorff-Michel simulations showing that the fundamental plasma distribution around a rotating neutron star consists of two polar domes and an equatorial torus of trapped nonneutral plasma of opposite sign charges. Unless a lot of new physics can be added, this distribution renders the Goldreich-Julian model irrelevant (i.e., along with most of the theoretical publications over the last 33 years).},

@article{chen_electrodynamics_2014,
	Abstract = {We present the first self-consistent global simulations of pulsar
magnetospheres with operating e {\textpm} discharge. We focus
on the simple configuration of an aligned or anti-aligned rotator. The
star is spun up from a zero (vacuum) state to a high angular velocity,
and we follow the coupled evolution of its external electromagnetic
field and plasma particles using the "particle-in-cell" method. A plasma
magnetosphere begins to form through the extraction of particles from
the star; these particles are accelerated by the rotation-induced
electric field, producing curvature radiation and igniting e
{\textpm} discharge. We follow the system evolution for
several revolution periods, longer than required to reach a quasi-steady
state. Our numerical experiment puts to test previous ideas for the
plasma flow and gaps in the pulsar magnetosphere. We first consider
rotators capable of producing pairs out to the light cylinder through
photon-photon collisions. We find that their magnetospheres are similar
to the previously obtained force-free solutions with a Y-shaped current
sheet. The magnetosphere continually ejects e {\textpm} pairs
and ions. Pair creation is sustained by a strong electric field along
the current sheet. We observe powerful curvature and synchrotron
emission from the current sheet, consistent with Fermi observations of
gamma-ray pulsars. We then study pulsars that can only create pairs in
the strong-field region near the neutron star, well inside the light
cylinder. We find that both aligned and anti-aligned rotators relax to
the "dead" state with suppressed pair creation and electric currents,
regardless of the discharge voltage.},

@article{jackson_new_1976,
	Abstract = {A model for the plasma atmosphere about a rotating magnetized neutron star with aligned magnetic and rotational axes is developed using a gedanken experiment in order to avoid considering at one time all of the phenomena produced by the extreme parameters associated with real pulsars. In this approach, the angular velocity of the star is
adiabatically increased in time, with the two axes aligned so that no dependence on the toroidal variable is introduced. The conclusions which appear to yield a consistent model are: (1) the star acquires a net charge that produces a monopole electric field which dominates the dipole magnetic field at large distances and causes particles emitted at the polar caps to cross the magnetic surface at these distances, forming a current loop between the caps and the polar annuli; (2) the primary current loop is not connected to the nebula and produces no energy loss due to particle emission into it; (3) a steady-state (possibly
turbulent) component of the atmosphere exists around a force-free surface which forms a dome over the polar cap; (4) the dome will have a continuous influx from primary beam particles, which are trapped due to their radiation loss; and (5) the toroidal drift velocity is not corotational, which is consistent with closed magnetic-field lines.},

@article{yuki_particle_2012,
	Abstract = {To explain the pulsed emission of the rotation powered pulsars from radio to gamma-ray, polar cap models, slot gap models, and outer gap models are proposed. Recent observations suggest that these models are likely to co-exist in the same magnetosphere. If so, their mutual relation is known to be troublesome (Harding 2009), due to the boundary conditions and the direction of the current, which are properly assumed in each acceleration model. We performed a particle simulation for the global magnetospheric structure. Based on this simulation, we present a new picture of the global structure of the pulsar magnetosphere. It is found that a new dead zone is formed along the current neutral line that separates the oppositely directed current. We shall call this the current-neutral zone. We suggest that the polar cap accelerators and the slot gaps locate above the current-neutral zone, and the outer gap exist between the current neutral zone and the traditional dead zone. We also give an estimate of the super-rotation region.},

Consideration is given to the region of a neutron star magnetosphere with steady, space charge limited flow along open magnetic field lines. A model using the explicit solutions to the Maxwell equations is used to demonstrate the general relativity effects on the electric field of this region. The incorporation of the dragging effect of inertial frames of reference made it possible to demonstrate the possibility of generation of an electric field component, which is relativistic in origin and is proportional to cos chi, where chi is the inclination angle of a pulsar. For an oblique rotator, the characteristic magnitude of the electric field is approximately 400 (rg/a)P exp 1/2 times stronger than that in a flat space-time limit.},

@article{beloborodov_untwisting_2009,
	Abstract = {Magnetospheres of neutron stars are anchored in the rigid crust and can be twisted by sudden crustal motions ("starquakes"). The twisted magnetosphere does not remain static and gradually untwists, dissipating magnetic energy and producing radiation. The equation describing this evolution is derived, and its solutions are presented. Two distinct regions coexist in untwisting magnetospheres: a potential region where ? {\texttimes} B = 0 ("cavity") and a current-carrying bundle of field lines with ? {\texttimes} B /= 0 ("j-bundle"). The cavity has a sharp boundary, which expands with time and eventually erases all of the twist. In this process, the electric current of the j-bundle is sucked into the star. Observational appearance of the untwisting process is discussed. A hot spot forms at the footprints of the j-bundle. The spot shrinks with time toward the magnetic dipole axis, and its luminosity and temperature gradually decrease. As the j-bundle shrinks, the amplitude of its twist $\psi$ can grow to the maximum possible value $\psi$max {\textasciitilde} 1. The strong twist near the dipole axis increases the spindown rate of the star and can generate a broad beam of radio emission. The model explains the puzzling behavior of magnetar XTE J1810-197, a canonical example of magnetospheric evolution following a starquake. We also discuss implications for other magnetars. The untwisting theory suggests that the nonthermal radiation of magnetars is preferentially generated on a bundle of extended closed field lines near the dipole axis.},

@techreport{gruzinov_aristotelian_2013,
	Abstract = {In Aristotelian Electrodynamics (AE), due to radiation over-damping, the velocity rather than the acceleration of a charge is determined by the local electromagnetic field. Treating electrons and positrons separately, AE seems to give a faithful description of the flow of charges in a pulsar magnetosphere. AE might allow to calculate the pulsar emission in full detail, at all energies except the radio. But AE is not a full theory -- the plasma production processes must be added. Here we show that the pulsar magnetosphere and the resulting emission are sensitive to the plasma production rate near the light cylinder. In strong pulsars (high production rate, due to photon-photon collisions), the number of field lines closing beyond the light cylinder decreases. This reduces both the pulsar efficiency (the ratio of the pulsed bolometric luminosity to the spin-down power) and the characteristic photon energy, in overall agreement with the Fermi data. For weak pulsars (low production rate), our numerical implementation of AE works stably and seems to be ready to calculate the lightcurves and spectra. But for strong pulsars, the code (included) needs improvement or better understanding.},

The axisymmetric simulations include rotation of the neutron star and the magnetic wind through the light cylinder. We study how the increasing twist affects the spindown rate of the star, finding that a dramatic increase in spindown occurs. Particularly spectacular are explosive events caused by the sudden opening of large amounts of overtwisted magnetic flux, which may be associated with the observed giant flares. These events are accompanied by a short period of ultrastrong spindown, resulting in an abrupt increase in spin period, such as was observed in the giant flare of SGR 1900+14.},

@article{de_jager_gamma-ray_1996,
	Abstract = {Phase I and II EGRET observations of the Crab Nebula establish the
synchro-Compton unpulsed spectrum between approximately 70 MeV and 30
GeV. The soft 70-150 MeV spectrum appears to be a steepened extension of
the 1-30 MeV COMPTEL spectrum recently reported by Much et al.,
indicating that the nebular synchrotron spectrum cuts off with an
e-folding energy E0 \~{} 26 MeV. This energy is consistent
with the characteristic synchrotron energy h$\upsilon$max \~{}
(3/4$\pi$ )2hc/r0 = 25 MeV (with r0
being the classical electron radius) expected for the synchrotron
burnoff if electrons are accelerated on a timescale equal to the
electron gyro- period in the inner nebula. The 70-150 MeV emission in
the exponential tail of this cutoff decreased by a factor of about 2
between 1991 and 1993, which is consistent with an approximately 25\%
reduction in E0 over that time.

A steady hard, approximately E-1.85 photon spectrum, added to
the synchrotron component, is required for energies up to 10 GeV. This
spectrum steepens toward the observed TeV $\gamma$-ray spectrum and may
represent the expected nebular inverse-Compton (IC) component, which
allows a measurement of the mean nebular field strength: from EGRET we
obtain barB \~{} 0.13 mG for the radio nebula, whereas the various
reported TeV observations correspond to a larger barB \~{} 0.26 mG
for the smaller optical nebula. The observation of the IC component also

@article{swanson_plasma_2003,
	Abstract = {To a beginner in plasma physics the subject of waves can be bewildering, with a seeming myriad of different wave modes and ways of approaching them though cold plasma equations, warm plasma equations or kinetic equations. Add to this the intricacies of Landau and cyclotron damping and the fact that real plasmas are rarely uniform and infinite in extent, even as a first approximation, and the need for a reliable guide through the maze becomes apparent. This is a revised and extended version of a book which has already proved its value as an advanced text at postgraduate level. It contains a careful account of many of the properties of waves using the various possible levels of approach, and a good selection of graphs and surface plots which are a great help to the reader in visualising the behaviour of wave dispersion relations. As might be expected by anyone familiar with the author's research, there is an extensive discussion of waves in an inhomogeneous plasma and the phenomenon of mode conversion which plays a vital role in various plasma heating schemes using waves. Various aspects of the nonlinear theory of waves are discussed, including quasilinear theory, solitons, particle trapping and parametric instability. The discussion throughout is characterised by a clear treatment of both the mathematical problems involved and the underlying physics, the second edition having provided an opportunity for refinement and clarification of the earlier presentation, as well as the addition of new material on recent advances in the subject. Any student who masters the material in this book and works through the problems it contains will have a very solid grounding in the theory of wave propagation. Research workers in the field will find it to be a comprehensive source of information on waves, including a number of topics which have only been found in research papers until now. I think that this is a very welcome addition to the literature which will be a valuable resource for teachers and researchers. Most people with a serious interest in plasma waves will probably think of the work by Stix (Stix T H 1992 Waves in Plasmas (New York: American Institute of Physics)) and its earlier edition as having been the standard work on plasma waves for many years and will wonder how this book compares. The answer is, I think, that the two works complement each other well. Where they overlap the discussion is generally somewhat different and can yield different insights, and each contains material absent from the other. Swanson's book is certainly worth a place beside Stix on the bookshelves of anyone who needs to know about plasma waves. R A Cairns},

@article{dyks_two-pole_2003,
	Abstract = {We present a new model of high-energy light curves from rotation-powered pulsars. The key ingredient of the model is the gap region (i.e., the region where particle acceleration is taking place and high-energy photons originate) that satisfies the following assumptions: (1) the gap region extends from each polar cap to the light cylinder; (2) the gap is thin and confined to the surface of last open magnetic-field lines; (3) photon emissivity is uniform within the gap region. The model light curves are dominated by strong peaks (either double or single) of caustic origin. Unlike other pulsar models with caustic effects, the double peaks arise from a crossing two caustics, each of which is associated with a different magnetic pole. The generic features of the light curves are consistent with the observed characteristics of pulsar light curves: (1) the most natural (in terms of probability) shape consists of two peaks (separated by 0.4 to 0.5 in phase for large viewing angles); (2) the peaks possess well-developed wings; (3) there is a bridge (interpeak) emission component; (4) there is a nonvanishing off-pulse emission level; (5) the radio pulse occurs before the leading high-energy peak. The model is well suited for four gamma-ray
pulsars-Crab, Vela, Geminga, and B1951+32-with double-peak light curves exhibiting the peak separation of 0.4 to 0.5 in phase. Here we apply the model to the Vela pulsar. Moreover, we indicate the limitation of the model in accurate reproducing of the light curves with single pulses and narrowly separated (about 0.2 in phase) pulse peaks. We also discuss the optical polarization properties for the Crab pulsar in the context of the two-pole caustic model.},

@article{beloborodov_mechanism_2013,
	Abstract = {Persistent activity of magnetars is associated with electric discharge that continually injects relativistic particles into the magnetosphere. Large active magnetic loops around magnetars must be filled with outflowing particles that interact with radiation via resonant scattering and spawn electron-positron pairs. The outflow energy is processed into copious e {\textpm} until the plasma enters outer parts of the loop where the magnetic field is reduced below 1013 G. In the outer zone, photons scattered by the outflow do not convert to e {\textpm} pairs and the outflow radiates its energy away. The escaping radiation forms a distinct hard X-ray peak in the magnetar spectrum. It has the following features: (1) its luminosity L = 1035-1036 erg s-1 can easily exceed the thermal luminosity from the magnetar surface, (2) its spectrum extends from 10 keV to the MeV band with a hard spectral slope, which depends on the object inclination to the line of sight, (3) the anisotropic hard X-ray emission exhibits strong pulsations as the magnetar spins, (4) the emission spectrum typically peaks around 1 MeV, but the peak position significantly oscillates with the spin period, (5) the emission is dominated by the extraordinary polarization mode at photon energies below {\textasciitilde}1 MeV, and (6) the decelerated pairs accumulate and annihilate at the top of the magnetic loop, and emit the 511 keV line with luminosity L ann {\textasciitilde} 0.1 L. Features (1)-(3) agree with available data; (4)-(6) can be tested by future observations.},

@article{beloborodov_magnetar_2016,
	Abstract = {We examine four candidate mechanisms that could explain the high surface temperatures of magnetars. (1) Heat flux from the liquid core heated by ambipolar diffusion. It could sustain the observed surface luminosity \$L\_s{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{35\}\$ erg/s if core heating offsets neutrino cooling at a temperature \$T\_\{core\}{\textgreater}6{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}8\$ K. This scenario is viable if the core magnetic field exceeds \$10{\textasciicircum}\{16\}\$ G and the heat-blanketing envelope of the magnetar has a light element composition. We find however that the lifetime of such a hot core should be shorter than the typical observed lifetime of magnetars. (2) Mechanical dissipation in the solid crust. This heating can be quasi-steady, powered by gradual (or frequent) crustal yielding to magnetic stresses. We show that it obeys a strong upper limit. As long as the crustal stresses are fostered by the field evolution in the core or Hall drift in the crust, mechanical heating is insufficient to sustain persistent \$L\_s{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{35\}\$ erg/s. The surface luminosity is increased in an alternative scenario of mechanical deformations triggered by external magnetospheric flares. (3) Ohmic dissipation in the crust, in volume or current sheets. This mechanism is inefficient because of the high conductivity of the crust. Only extreme magnetic configurations with crustal fields \$B{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{16\}\$ G varying on a 100 meter scale could provide \$L\_s{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{35\}\$ erg/s. (4) Bombardment of the stellar surface by particles accelerated in the magnetosphere. This mechanism produces hot spots on magnetars. Observations of transient magnetars show evidence for external heating.},

@article{beloborodov_electron-positron_2012,
	Abstract = {The twisted magnetospheres of magnetars must sustain a persistent flow of electron-positron plasma. The flow dynamics is controlled by the radiation field around the hot neutron star. The problem of plasma motion in the self-consistent radiation field is solved using the method of virtual beams. The plasma and radiation exchange momentum via resonant scattering and self-organize into the "radiatively locked" outflow with a well-defined, decreasing Lorentz factor. There is an extended zone around the magnetar where the plasma flow is ultra-relativistic; its Lorentz factor is self-regulated so that it can marginally scatter thermal photons. The flow becomes slow and opaque in an outer equatorial zone, where the decelerated plasma accumulates and annihilates; this region serves as a reflector for the thermal photons emitted by the neutron star. The e+- flow carries electric current, which is sustained by a moderate induced electric field. The electric field maintains a separation between the electron and positron velocities, against the will of the radiation field. The two-stream instability is then inevitable, and the induced turbulence can generate low-frequency emission. In particular, radio emission may escape around the magnetic dipole axis of the star. Most of the flow energy is converted to hard X-ray emission, which is examined in the accompanying paper.},

@article{beloborodov_activated_2011,
	Abstract = {Like the solar corona, the external magnetic field of magnetars is twisted by surface motions of the star. The twist energy is dissipated over time. We discuss the theory of this activity and its observational status. (1) Theory predicts that the magnetosphere tends to untwist in a peculiar way: a bundle of electric currents (the "j-bundle") is formed with a sharp boundary, which shrinks toward the magnetic dipole axis. Recent observations of shrinking hot spots on magnetars are consistent with this behavior. (2) Continual discharge fills the j-bundle with e{\textpm} plasma, maintaining a nonthermal corona around the neutron
star. The corona outside a few stellar radii strongly interacts with the stellar radiation and forms a "radiatively locked" outflow with a high e{\textpm} multiplicity. The locked plasma annihilates near the apexes of the closed magnetic field lines. (3) New radiative-transfer simulations suggest a simple mechanismthat shapes the observed X-ray spectrumfrom 0.1 keV to 1MeV: part of the thermal X-rays emitted by the neutron star are reflected from the outer corona and then upscattered by the inner relativistic outflow in the j-bundle, producing a beam of hard X-rays.},

compared with observations of quiescent emission from the soft gamma

previously identified with such objects. The magnetic field, rather than
rotation, provides the main source of free energy, and the decaying
field is capable of powering the quiescent X-ray emission and particle
emission observed from these sources. New features that are not present
in the decay of the weaker fields associated with ordinary radio pulsars
include fracturing of the neutron star crust, strong heating of its
core, and effective suppression of thermal conduction perpendicular to
the magnetic field. As the magnetic field is forced through the crust by
diffusive motions in the core, multiple small-scale fractures are
excited, as well as a few large fractures that can power soft gamma
repeater bursts. The decay rate of the core field is a very strong
function of temperature and therefore of the magnetic flux density. The
strongest prediction of the model is that these sources will show no

A minimum of \$ {\textbackslash}approx 20{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the electromagnetic spindown luminosity is transferred to the particles in the dissipative regions, predominantly in the vicinity of the Y-point. The value of the spindown luminosity is in rough agreement with the force-free value, but can differ by tens of percent even when the characteristic magnetization at the light cylinder is high (\${\textbackslash}sigma {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}3-10{\textasciicircum}4\$). This is because the magnetization in the vicinity of the Y-point is orders of magnitude lower than the characteristic magnetization at the light cylinder. As a result, particle inertia is important at the Y-point, and field lines are forced open there leading to a greater value of open magnetic flux and spindown luminosity compared to the force-free model.},

@article{levinson_large-amplitude_2005,
	Abstract = {A time-dependent model for pair creation in a pulsar magnetosphere is developed in which the parallel electric field oscillates with large amplitude. Electrons and positrons are accelerated periodically, and the amplitude of the oscillations is assumed to be large enough to cause creation of upgoing and downgoing pairs at different phases of the oscillation. With a charge-starved initial condition, we find that the oscillations result in bursts of pair creation in which the pair density rises exponentially with time. The pair density saturates at N+/-{\textasciitilde}=E20/(8$\pi$mec2$\Gamma$thr), where E0 is the parallel electric field in the charge-starved initial state and $\Gamma$thr is the Lorentz factor for effective pair creation. The frequency of oscillations following the pair creation burst is given roughly by $\omega$osc=eE0/(8mec$\Gamma$thr). A positive feedback keeps the system stable, such that the average pair creation rate balances the loss rate due to pairs escaping the magnetosphere.},

@article{petri_diocotron_2002,
	Abstract = {In a previous work, we have shown that the electrospheric plasma of a pulsar's magnetosphere with vacuum gaps is subject to differential rotation in the equatorial belt. Here we examine the stability of a simplified model of this belt. The model consists of a charged thin plasma disc in differential rotation, embedded in a dipolar magnetic field anchored in the neutron star. In the linearized electrostatic perturbation approximation, this disc appears to be unstable to the so-called diocotron instability. We present several eigenspectra and eigenfunctions for different disc models, which differ by the total charge of the disc-star system. Velocity and electric field
perturbations are also shown in the disc plane for a few fast-growing modes. Increasing the total charge has a stabilizing effect, in the sense that the growth rate of the fastest-growing eigenvalue decreases with total charge and eventually vanishes. When the system is unstable, the growth rates are of the order of the azimuthal rotation rate. This means that the diocotron instability, which develops in a few pulsar's periods, should be very efficient in causing particles to migrate across magnetic surfaces.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the linear stability of the system formed by an electron beam and its return plasma current within a general framework, namely, for any orientation of the wave vector  k  with respect to the beam and without any a priori assumption on the orientation of the electric field with respect to  k . We apply this formalism to three configurations: cold beam and cold plasma, cold beam and hot plasma, and cold relativistic beam and hot plasma. We proceed to the identification and systematic study of the two branches of the electromagnetic dispersion relation. One pertains to Weibel-like beam modes with transverse electric proper waves. The other one refers to electric proper waves belonging to the plane formed by  k  and the beam, it divides between Weibel-like beam modes and a branch sweeping from longitudinal two-stream modes to purely transverse filamentation modes. For this latter branch, we thoroughly investigate the intermediate regime between two-stream and filamentation instabilities for arbitrary wave vectors. When some plasma temperature is allowed for, the system exhibits a critical angle at which waves are unstable for every  k . Besides, in the relativistic regime, the most unstable mode on this branch is reached for an oblique wave vector. This study is especially relevant to the fast ignition scenario as its generality could help clarify some confusing linear issues of present concern. This is a prerequisite towards more sophisticated nonlinear treatments.},

@article{shibata_self-consistent_1985,
	Abstract = {In order to construct an axisymmetric model of magnetospheres with centrifugal wind, especially of the type II magnetosphere described by Shibata and Kaburaki (1984), a numerical iterative scheme is presented in which a tenuous plasma with conspicuous transfield motion is treated self-consistently with the electromagnetic field. Since the
characteristic equations of the flow are solved, there are no numerical diffusion terms obscuring the cause of the transfield motion. The obtained properties of type II magnetosphere are as follows: plasma particles in fact flow out across the closed magnetic-field lines; centrifugal force is exerted powerfully on the positive particles to form a disk-like structure, and the strong electric force makes the negative particles drift to the disk; and the electric field parallel to the disk (Ep) appears and is shown to be necessary for the steady wind to exist. Within the range of the model parameters selected, two reasons for the appearance of Ep are found: plasma density decreases owing to the centrifugal acceleration and becomes insufficient to shield Ep, and the plasma with large inertia moves so as to reduce the charge
separation, which would be necessary to shield Ep.},

@article{wada_particle_2011,
	Abstract = {The main issue regarding the pulsar magnetosphere is how the rotation
power is converted into both particle beams which cause pulsed
emissions, and a highly relativistic wind of electron-positron plasmas
which forms surrounding nebulae shining in X-rays and TeV $\gamma$-rays.
As a sequel to our previous paper, we carried out a three-dimensional
particle simulation for the axisymmetric global magnetosphere. We
present the results of additional calculations, which are higher
resolution models and higher pair creation rate cases, and a detailed
analysis for the solution. We confined our work to demonstrating the
cases of low pair creation rates, i.e. where the magnetic field is a
fixed dipole. The radiation drag of the plasma was taken to be in a form
with the curvature radius along the dipole magnetic field. The
electrostatic interactions were calculated using a programmable
special-purpose computer, GRAPE-DR. We found that once pair creation
begins in the outer gaps, both positively and negatively charged
particles begin to drift across the closed magnetic field due to
radiation drag, and they create an outflow. Eventually, the steady
magnetosphere has outer gaps, both positively and negatively charged
outflow of plasma and a region in which the electric field is dominant
extending from the equator. In the steady state, the magnetic field
generated by the magnetospheric current is comparable to the dipole
magnetic field outside several light radii from the star. In a much
higher pair creation rate model, the effect of the modification of the
magnetic field will bring about modification of the outflow of the
plasma, requiring further study with a higher pair creation rate model
in a subsequent paper.},

Substantial progress has been made also on the theoretical side. Quite detailed models for explaining the magnetars{\textquoteright} persistent x-ray

The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive overview in which the observational results are discussed in the light of the most up-to-date theoretical models and their implications.

	Abstract = {This paper discusses a quasi-static evolution of a force-free magnetic
field under slow sheared footpoint motions on the plasma's boundary, an
important problem with applications to the solar and accretion disk
coronae. The main qualitative features of the evolution (such as
field-line expansion and opening) are considered, and a comparison is
made between two different geometrical settings: the Cartesian case with
translational symmetry along a straight line, and the axisymmetric case
with axial symmetry around the rotation axis. The main question
addressed in the paper is whether a continuous sequence of force-free
equilibria describes the evolution at arbitrarily large values of the
footpoint displacement, or the sequence ends abruptly and the system
exhibits a loss of equilibrium at a finite footpoint displacement. After
a formal description of the problem, a review/discussion of the
extensive previous work on the subject is given. After that, a series of
simple scaling-type arguments, explaining the key essential reason for
the main qualitative difference between the two geometry types, is
presented. It is found that, in the Cartesian case, force-free
equilibria exist at arbitrarily large values of shear and the field
approaches the open state only at infinite shear, whereas in the
axisymmetric case the field opens up already at a finite shear.},

We test the model against observations of three magnetars: 4U 0142+61, 1RXS J1708-4009, and 1E 1841-045. We find that the model successfully fits the observed phase-resolved spectra. We derive constraints on the angle between the rotational and magnetic axes of the neutron star, the object inclination to the line of sight, and the size of the active twisted region filled with the plasma flow. Using the fit of the hard X-ray component of the magnetar spectrum, we revisit the remaining soft X-ray component. We find that it can be explained by a modified
two-temperature blackbody model. The hotter blackbody is consistent with a hot spot covering 1\%-10\% of the neutron star surface. Such a hot spot is expected at the base of the magnetospheric e {\textpm}
outflow, as some particles created in the e {\textpm}
discharge flow back and bombard the stellar surface.},

@article{lyutikov_explosive_2003,
	Abstract = {The X-ray activity of anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft $\gamma$-ray repeaters may result from the heating of their magnetic corona by direct currents dissipated by magnetic reconnection. We investigate the possibility that X-ray flares and bursts observed from anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft $\gamma$-ray repeaters result from magnetospheric
reconnection events initiated by development of the tearing mode in magnetically dominated relativistic plasma. We formulate equations of resistive force-free electrodynamics, discuss the relation of the latter to ideal electrodynamics, and give examples of both ideal and resistive equilibria. Resistive force-free current layers are unstable towards the development of small-scale current sheets where resistive effects become important. Thin current sheets are found to be unstable due to the development of the resistive force-free tearing mode. The growth rate of the tearing mode is intermediate between the short Alfv{\'e}n
time-scale $\tau$A and a long resistive time-scale
$\tau$R: $\Gamma${\textasciitilde}
1/($\tau$R$\tau$A)1/2, similar to the
case of non-relativistic non-force-free plasma. We propose that growth of the tearing mode is related to the typical rise time of flares, {\textasciitilde}10 ms. Finally, we discuss how reconnection may explain other magnetar phenomena and ways to test the model.},

@article{kennel_pulsar_1979,
	Abstract = {The structure of both the interior and exterior pulsar magnetosphere depends upon the strength of its plasma source near the surface of the star. We review magnetospheric models in the light of a vacuum
pair-production source model proposed by Sturrock, and Ruderman and Sutherland. This model predicts the existence of a cutoff, determined by the neutron star's spin rate and magnetic field strength, beyond which coherent radio emission is no longer possible. The observed distribution of pulsar spin periods and period derivatives, and the distribution of pulsars with missing radio pulses, is quantitatively consistent with the pair production threshold, when its variation of neutron star radius and moment of inertia with mass is taken into account. All neutron stars observed as pulsars can have relativistic magnetohydrodynamic wind exterior magnetospheres. The properties of the wind can be directly related to those of the pair production source. Radio pulsars cannot have relativistic plasma wave exterior magnetospheres. On the other hand, most erstwhile pulsars in the galaxy are probably halo objects that emit weak fluxes of energetic photons that can have relativistic wave exterior magnetospheres. Extinct pulsars have not been yet
observed.},

@article{mestel_axisymmetric_1985,
	Abstract = {A tentative model is discussed for the steady spin-down of an aligned rapidly rotating magnetic neutron star within the framework of classical physics. The electron currents which exert the braking torque on the star flow from the polar caps out to and beyond the light-cylinder, picking up energy from the electric force and angular momentum from the magnetic torque. At high enough energies the electrons emit incoherent gamma radiation; the associated loss of angular momentum enables the currents to cross magnetic field lines and so ultimately to return to the star at lower latitudes. Several examples are constructed that illustrate the required flow, but no claim is made that an acceptable approximation to a fully self-consistent model has yet been achieved. Reasons are given why such a classical model may spontaneously convert itself through pair production into a quantum model, in which
circulation of primary electrons would still play an essential part.},

The energy dissipated in a glitch is such that motion of both solid and liquid phases during and after spin-up is strictly constrained to surfaces of constant chemical composition. The amorphous and heterogeneous nature of the solid phase of neutron star matter is used to deduce the qualitative form of the dissipative force acting on unit length of a neutron vortex as a function of its velocity. The analysis of post-glitch relaxation given here is necessarily qualitative owing to the stochastic nature of the model, but is
consistent with both the normal and anomalous cases observed.},

The First Fermi-LAT catalog (1FGL) contains 1451 sources detected and
characterized in the 100 MeV to 100 GeV range. Source detection was based on the average flux over the 11 month period, and the threshold likelihood Test Statistic is 25, corresponding to a significance of just over 4$\sigma$. The 1FGL catalog includes source location regions,
defined in terms of elliptical fits to the 95\% confidence regions and power-law spectral fits as well as flux measurements in five energy bands for each source. In addition, monthly light curves are provided. Using a protocol defined before launch we have tested for several populations of gamma-ray sources among the sources in the catalog. For individual LAT-detected sources we provide firm identifications or plausible associations with sources in other astronomical catalogs. Identifications are based on correlated variability with counterparts at other wavelengths, or on spin or orbital periodicity. For the catalogs and association criteria that we have selected, 630 of the sources are unassociated. Care was taken to characterize the sensitivity of the results to the model of interstellar diffuse gamma-ray emission used to model the bright foreground, with the result that 161 sources at low Galactic latitudes and toward bright local interstellar clouds are flagged as having properties that are strongly dependent on the model or as potentially being due to incorrectly modeled structure in the Galactic diffuse emission.},

	Abstract = {We report on the Fermi-LAT observations of the Geminga pulsar, the second brightest non-variable GeV source in the $\gamma$-ray sky and the first example of a radio-quiet $\gamma$-ray pulsar. The observations
cover one year, from the launch of the Fermi satellite through 2009 June 15. A data sample of over 60,000 photons enabled us to build a timing solution based solely on $\gamma$-rays. Timing analysis shows two
prominent peaks, separated by $\Delta$phi = 0.497 {\textpm} 0.004 in
phase, which narrow with increasing energy. Pulsed $\gamma$-rays are
observed beyond 18 GeV, precluding emission below 2.7 stellar radii because of magnetic absorption. The phase-averaged spectrum was fitted with a power law with exponential cutoff of spectral index $\Gamma$ =
(1.30 {\textpm} 0.01 {\textpm} 0.04), cutoff energy E 0 = (2.46
{\textpm} 0.04 {\textpm} 0.17) GeV, and an integral photon flux above 0.1
GeV of (4.14 {\textpm} 0.02 {\textpm} 0.32) {\texttimes} 10-6
cm-2 s-1. The first uncertainties are statistical and the second ones are systematic. The phase-resolved spectroscopy shows a clear evolution of the spectral parameters, with the spectral index reaching a minimum value just before the leading peak and the cutoff energy having maxima around the peaks. The phase-resolved spectroscopy reveals that pulsar emission is present at all rotational phases. The spectral shape, broad pulse profile, and maximum photon energy favor the outer magnetospheric emission scenarios.},

@article{fichtel_high-energy_1975,
	Abstract = {Data are reported which were obtained with a high-energy (exceeding 35 Mev) gamma-ray telescope flown on the second Small Astronomy Satellite (SAS-2). The high-energy galactic gamma radiation is observed to dominate over the general diffuse radiation along the entire galactic plane, and its longitudinal and latitudinal distributions appear to be generally correlated with galactic structural features, particularly with arm segments. Principally on the basis of its angular distribution and magnitude, it is suggested that this radiation results primarily from cosmic-ray interactions with interstellar matter. A uniform celestial gamma radiation appears to have been detected; the form of its differential spectrum over the energy range from about 35 to 170 MeV is obtained, and a cosmological origin is suggested for this radiation. In addition to the general galactic emission, high-energy gamma radiation was detected from the Crab Nebula, Vela X, a general region toward the galactic center, and a region located a few degrees north of the galactic plane. Upper limits to the high-energy gamma ray fluxes are set for a number of localized sources.},

Small Astronomy Satellite has collected over one thousand gamma rays
from the direction of the galactic anticenter. In addition to the
diffuse galactic emission the distribution indicates a strong pulsed
contribution from the Crab nebula with the same period and phase as the

(gal. long. 195 deg; gal. lat +5 deg) where there is a region containing
old supernova remnants. Search for gamma ray pulsations from other

	Abstract = {This catalog summarizes 117 high-confidence {\textgreater}=0.1 GeV gamma-ray pulsar detections using three years of data acquired by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi satellite. Half are neutron stars
discovered using LAT data through periodicity searches in gamma-ray and radio data around LAT unassociated source positions. The 117 pulsars are evenly divided into three groups: millisecond pulsars, young radio-loud pulsars, and young radio-quiet pulsars. We characterize the pulse profiles and energy spectra and derive luminosities when distance information exists. Spectral analysis of the off-peak phase intervals indicates probable pulsar wind nebula emission for four pulsars, and off-peak magnetospheric emission for several young and millisecond pulsars. We compare the gamma-ray properties with those in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands. We provide flux limits for pulsars with no observed gamma-ray emission, highlighting a small number of gamma-faint, radio-loud pulsars. The large, varied gamma-ray pulsar sample constrains emission models. Fermi's selection biases complement those of radio surveys, enhancing comparisons with predicted population distributions.},

@article{abdo_first_2010,
	Abstract = {The dramatic increase in the number of known gamma-ray pulsars since the launch of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (formerly GLAST) offers the first opportunity to study a sizable population of these high-energy objects. This catalog summarizes 46 high-confidence pulsed detections using the first six months of data taken by the Large Area Telescope (LAT), Fermi's main instrument. Sixteen previously unknown pulsars were discovered by searching for pulsed signals at the positions of bright gamma-ray sources seen with the LAT, or at the positions of objects suspected to be neutron stars based on observations at other
wavelengths. The dimmest observed flux among these gamma-ray-selected pulsars is 6.0 {\texttimes} 10-8 ph cm-2 s-1 (for E{\textgreater}100 MeV). Pulsed gamma-ray emission was discovered from 24 known pulsars by using ephemerides (timing solutions) derived from monitoring radio pulsars. Eight of these new gamma-ray pulsars are millisecond pulsars. The dimmest observed flux among the radio-selected pulsars is 1.4 {\texttimes} 10-8 ph cm-2 s-1 (for E{\textgreater}100 MeV). The remaining six gamma-ray pulsars were known since the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory mission, or before. The limiting flux for pulse detection is non-uniform over the sky owing to different background levels, especially near the Galactic plane. The pulsed energy spectra can be described by a power law with an exponential cutoff, with cutoff energies in the range {\textasciitilde}1-5 GeV. The rotational energy-loss rate ({\.E}) of these neutron stars spans five decades, from {\textasciitilde}3 {\texttimes}
1033 erg s-1 to 5 {\texttimes} 1038 erg
s-1, and the apparent efficiencies for conversion to
gamma-ray emission range from {\textasciitilde}0.1\% to {\textasciitilde} unity, although distance uncertainties complicate efficiency estimates. The pulse shapes show substantial diversity, but roughly 75\% of the gamma-ray pulse profiles have two peaks, separated by gsim0.2 of rotational phase. For most of the pulsars, gamma-ray emission appears to come mainly from the outer magnetosphere, while polar-cap emission remains plausible for a
remaining few. Spatial associations imply that many of these pulsars power pulsar wind nebulae. Finally, these discoveries suggest that gamma-ray-selected young pulsars are born at a rate comparable to that of their radio-selected cousins and that the birthrate of all young gamma-ray-detected pulsars is a substantial fraction of the expected Galactic supernova rate.},

@article{petri_relativistic_2007,
	Abstract = {Context: The physics of the pulsar inner magnetosphere remains poorly
constrained by observations. Although about 2000 pulsars have been
discovered to date, only a little is known about their emission
mechanism. Large vacuum gaps exist in the magnetosphere, and a
non-neutral plasma partially fills the neutron star surroundings to form
an electrosphere. Aims: In a previous work, we showed that the
differentially rotating equatorial disk in the pulsar's electrosphere is
diocotron unstable in the non-relativistic regime. In this paper, we
extend these results and study the relativistic and electromagnetic
stabilisation effects by including the magnetic field perturbation and
allowing for relativistic speeds of the guiding centre, in a
self-consistent manner. We use the electric drift approximation, valid
for low-density plasmas. Methods: We linearise the coupled
relativistic cold-fluid and Maxwell equations in the electric drift
approximation. The non-linear eigenvalue problem for the perturbed
azimuthal electric field is solved numerically with standard techniques
for boundary value problems like the shooting method. The spectrum of
the relativistic diocotron instability is computed in a non-neutral
plasma column confined between two cylindrically conducting walls. Results: For low-speed motions, we recover the eigenfunctions and
eigenspectra of the non-relativistic diocotron instability. Our
algorithm is also checked in the relativistic planar diode geometry for
which an analytical expression of the dispersion relation is known. As
expected, when the relativistic and electromagnetic effects become
significant, the diocotron instability tends to stabilise. In
cylindrical geometry, for some special rotation profiles, all azimuthal
modes l are completely suppressed for sufficiently relativistic flows.
However, for the profile relevant to the electrosphere, depending on the
exact rotation curves, the growth rates can either significantly
decrease till they vanish or persist for moderate l. Conclusions:
The non-neutral plasma flowing in the pulsar electrosphere approaches
the speed of light when reaching the light-cylinder. Therefore,
relativistic and electromagnetic effects are important. They are able to
completely suppress the diocotron instability. Nevertheless, results are
sensitive to the tail of the rotation curves; therefore, particle
diffusion across the magnetic field due to the diocotron instability
only works efficiently close to the neutron star surface.},

The bulk of this activity is explained by the evolution and decay of an ultrastrong magnetic field, stressing and breaking the neutron star crust, which in turn drives twists of the external
magnetosphere and powerful magnetospheric currents. The population of detected magnetars has grown to about 30 objects and shows unambiguous phenomenological connection with very highly magnetized radio pulsars. Recent progress in magnetar theory includes explanation of the hard X-ray component in the magnetar spectrum and development of surface heating models, explaining the sources' remarkable radiative output.},

	Abstract = {Soft $\gamma$-ray repeaters (SGRs) emit multiple, brief ({\textasciitilde}0.1-s), intense
outbursts of low-energy $\gamma$-rays. They are extremely rare-three are
known in our Galaxy and one in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Two SGRs are
associated with young supernova remnants (SNRs), and therefore most
probably with neutron stars, but it remains a puzzle why SGRs are so
different from `normal' radio pulsars. Here we report the discovery of
pulsations in the persistent X-ray flux of SGR1806 - 20, with a period
of 7.47s and a spindown rate of 2.6 {\texttimes}
10-3syr-1. We argue that the spindown is due to
magnetic dipole emission and find that the pulsar age and (dipolar)
magnetic field strength are {\textasciitilde}1,500 years and 8{\texttimes}
1014gauss, respectively. Our observations demonstrate the
existence of `magnetars', neutron stars with magnetic fields about 100
times stronger than those of radio pulsars, and support earlier
suggestions, that SGR bursts are caused by neutron-star `crustquakes'
produced by magnetic stresses. The `magnetar' birth rate is about one
per millennium-a substantial fraction of that of radio pulsars. Thus our
results may explain why some SNRs have no radio pulsars.},

A longer exposure image of the 1-deg field of view centered on the object reveals a clear semicircular arc which appears to be the outer shell of a supernova remnant, with a strong compact X-ray source at the center. Assuming the object to be a supernova remnant, a distance of 3.6 kpc is estimated, which implies a linear shell diameter of 38 pc, comparable to the Cygnus Loop and the Vela supernova remnant.

	Abstract = {An analysis is presented of Einstein Observatory observations of the point X-ray source 1E 2259 + 586 discovered within the supernova remnant-like extended X-ray source G109.1-1.0. Data were obtained with the Imaging Proportional Counter for a two-hour period, and analyzed by a straightforward period-folding technique. A strongly modulated signal with a period of 3.4890 + or - 0.0002 sec is obtained which is also found in the discovery observation made seven months earlier. The period and modulation of the variation are consistent with known X-ray pulsars, with X-ray luminosity due to accretion from a close companion. 1E 2259 + 586 thus represents the only known accretion-powered X-ray pulsar associated with a supernova remnant.},

	Abstract = {We present the latest results from a multi-epoch timing and spectral
study of the Transient Anomalous X-ray Pulsar XTE J1810 197. We have
acquired seven observations of this pulsar with the Newton X-ray
Multi-mirror Mission (XMM-Newton) over the course of two and a half
years, to follow the spectral evolution as the source fades from
outburst. The spectrum is arguably best characterized by a
two-temperature blackbody whose luminosities are decreasing
exponentially with $\tau$ 1=870 d and $\tau$ 2=280
d, respectively. The temperatures of these components are currently
cooling at a rate of 22\% per year from a nearly constant value recorded
at earlier epochs of kT 1=0.25 keV and kT 2=0.67
keV, respectively. The new data show that the temperature T 1
and luminosity of that component have nearly returned to their historic
quiescent levels and that its pulsed fraction, which has steadily
decreased with time, is now consistent with the previous lack of
detected pulsations in quiescence. We also summarize the detections of
radio emission from XTE J1810 197, the first confirmed for any AXP. We
consider possible models for the emission geometry and mechanisms of XTE
J1810 197.},

	Abstract = {The gamma-ray space telescopes AGILE and Fermi detected short and bright
synchrotron gamma-ray flares at photon energies above 100 MeV in the
Crab Nebula. This discovery suggests that electron-positron pairs in the
nebula are accelerated to PeV energies in a milligauss magnetic field,
which is difficult to explain with classical models of particle
acceleration and pulsar wind nebulae. We investigate whether particle
acceleration in a magnetic reconnection layer can account for the
puzzling properties of the flares. We numerically integrate relativistic
test-particle orbits in the vicinity of the layer, including the
radiation reaction force, and using analytical expressions for the
large-scale electromagnetic fields. As they get accelerated by the
reconnection electric field, the particles are focused deep inside the
current layer where the magnetic field is small. The electrons suffer
less from synchrotron losses and are accelerated to extremely high
energies. Population studies show that, at the end of the layer, the
particle distribution piles up at the maximum energy given by the
electric potential drop and is focused into a thin fan beam. Applying
this model to the Crab Nebula, we find that the emerging synchrotron
emission spectrum peaks above 100 MeV and is close to the spectral shape
of a single electron. The flare inverse Compton emission is negligible
and no detectable emission is expected at other wavelengths. This
mechanism provides a plausible explanation for the gamma-ray flares in
the Crab Nebula and could be at work in other astrophysical objects such
as relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei.},

	Abstract = {The Blandford-Znajek theory of a stationary, axisymmetric magnetosphere anchored in a black hole and in its accretion disk is reformulated and extended. It is noted that such a magnetosphere should transfer much of the rotational energy of the hole and orbital energy of the disk into an intense flux of electromagnetic energy - which in turn might be the energizer for quasars and active galactic nuclei. In addition, a general relativistic version of dc electronic theory is constructed and then used to elucidate the flows of electric current and electromagnetic power in the magnetosphere. The circuit-theory analysis, and
independently a torque-balance analysis, suggest that those magnetic field lines which thread the hole will be dragged into rotation with roughly half the angular velocity of the hole and, consequently, that the hole will deliver to the magnetosphere the maximum electromagnetic power allowed by the horizon strengths of the magnetic fields.},

	Abstract = {Gamma-ray emission from pulsars has long been modeled using a vacuum dipole field. This approximation ignores changes in the field structure caused by the magnetospheric plasma and strong plasma currents. We present the first results of gamma-ray pulsar light-curve modeling using the more realistic field taken from three-dimensional force-free (FF) magnetospheric simulations. Having the geometry of the field, we apply several prescriptions for the location of the emission zone, comparing the light curves to observations. We find that when the emission region is chosen according to the conventional slot-gap (or two-pole caustic) prescription, the model fails to produce double-peak pulse profiles, mainly because the size of the polar cap in the FF magnetosphere is larger than the vacuum field polar cap. This suppresses caustic
formation in the inner magnetosphere. The conventional outer-gap model is capable of producing only one peak under general conditions because a large fraction of open field lines does not cross the null charge surface. We propose a novel "separatrix layer" model, where the
high-energy emission originates from a thin layer on the open field lines just inside of the separatrix that bounds the open flux tube. The emission from this layer generates two strong caustics on the sky map due to the effect we term "Sky Map Stagnation" (SMS). It is related to the fact that the FF field asymptotically approaches the field of a rotating split monopole, and the photons emitted on such field lines in the outer magnetosphere arrive to the observer in phase. The double-peak light curve is a natural consequence of SMS. We show that most features of the currently available gamma-ray pulsar light curves can be
reasonably well reproduced and explained with the separatrix layer model using the FF field. Association of the emission region with the current sheet will guide more detailed future studies of the magnetospheric acceleration physics.},

@article{enoto_broadband_2010,
	Abstract = {Broadband (0.8-70 keV) spectra of the persistent X-ray emission from nine magnetars were obtained with Suzaku, including three objects in apparent outburst. The soft X-ray component was detected from all of them, with a typical blackbody temperature of kT {\textasciitilde} 0.5 keV, while the hard-tail component, dominating above {\textasciitilde}10 keV, was detected at {\textasciitilde}1 mCrab intensity from seven of them. Therefore, the spectrum composed of a soft emission and a hard-tail component may be considered to be a common property of magnetars, both in their active and quiescent states. Wide-band spectral analyses revealed that the hard-tail component has a 1-60 keV flux, F h, comparable to or even higher than that carried by the 1-60 keV soft component, F s. The hardness ratio (HR) of these objects, defined as $\xi$ = F h/F
s, was found to be tightly anti-correlated with their characteristic age $\tau$c as $\xi$ = (3.3 {\textpm} 0.3)
{\texttimes} ($\tau$c/1 kyr)-0.67{\textpm}0.04 with a
correlation coefficient of -0.989, over the range from $\xi$ {\textasciitilde} 10 to $\xi$ {\textasciitilde} 0.1. Magnetars in outburst states were found to lie on the same correlation as relatively quiescent ones. This HR is also positively correlated with their surface magnetic fields with a correlation coefficient of 0.873. In addition, the hard-tail component becomes harder toward sources with older characteristic ages, with the photon index changing from {\textasciitilde}1.7 to {\textasciitilde}0.4.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the time-averaged high-energy spectral characteristics
of the persistent anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) 1RXS J1708-4009, 4U
0142+61, 1E 2259+586, and 1E 1048.1-5937, using RXTE PCA (2-60 keV),
RXTE HEXTE (15-250 keV), and INTEGRAL IBIS ISGRI (20-300 keV) data. We
discovered hard spectral tails for energies above 10 keV in the total
and pulsed spectra of AXPs 1RXS J1708-4009, 4U 0142+4009, and 1E
2259+586, but 1E 1048.1-5937 appeared to be too weak to be detected.
Improved hard X-ray spectral information for AXP 1E 1841-045 is also
presented. The pulsed and total spectra above 10 keV have power-law
shapes, and there is so far no significant evidence for spectral breaks
or bends up to {\textasciitilde}150 keV. The pulsed spectra above 10 keV are
exceptionally hard with indices for four AXPs in the range -1.0 to 1.0.
Below 10 keV these indices were in the range 2.0-4.3, indicating the
very drastic spectral changes in a narrow energy interval around 10 keV.
The best-fit power-law models to the total spectra between {\textasciitilde}10 and 150
keV are significantly softer, with indices measured for 1E 1841-045,
1RXS J1708-4009, and 4U 0142+61 in the range 1.0-1.4. For the latter
AXPs the pulsed fractions are consistent with 100\% around 100 keV but
are different at 10 keV: {\textasciitilde}10\% for 4U 0142+61, {\textasciitilde}25\% for 1E 1841-045, and
consistent with 100\% for 1RXS J1708-4009. The luminosities of these
total and pulsed spectral tails (10-150 keV) largely exceed the total
available spin-down powers by factors ranging from {\textasciitilde}100 to {\textasciitilde}600. We also
reanalyzed archival CGRO COMPTEL (0.75-30 MeV) data: no AXP detections
can be claimed, and the obtained upper limits indicate for 1RXS
J1708-4009, 4U 0142+61, and 1E 1841-045 that strong breaks or bends must
occur somewhere between {\textasciitilde}150 and 750 keV. We discuss predictions from
first attempts to model our hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray spectra in the
context of the magnetar model.},

	Abstract = {We report here on the outburst onset and evolution of the new soft gamma-ray repeater SGR0501+4516. We monitored the new SGR with
XMM-Newton starting on 2008 August 23, 1 day after the source became burst active, and continuing with four more observations in the
following month, with the last one on 2008 September 30. Combining the data with the Swift X-ray telescope (Swift-XRT) and Suzaku data, we modelled the outburst decay over a 3-month period, and we found that the source flux decreased exponentially with a time-scale of tc = 23.8d. In the first XMM-Newton observation, a large number of short X-ray bursts were observed, the rate of which decayed drastically in the following observations. We found large changes in the spectral and timing behaviour of the source during the first month of the outburst decay, with softening emission as the flux decayed, and the non-thermal soft X-ray spectral component fading faster than the thermal one. Almost simultaneously to our second and fourth XMM-Newton observations (on 2008 August 29 and September 2), we observed the source in the hard X-ray range with INTEGRAL, which clearly detected the source up to {\textasciitilde}100keV in the first pointing, while giving only upper limits during the second pointing, discovering a variable hard X-ray component fading in less than 10days after the bursting activation. We performed a phase-coherent X-ray timing analysis over about 160days starting with the burst activation and found evidence of a strong second derivative period component []. Thanks to the phase connection, we were able to study the phase-resolved spectral evolution of SGR0501+4516 in great detail. We also report on the ROSAT quiescent source data, taken back in 1992 when the source exhibits a flux {\textasciitilde}80 times lower than that measured during the outburst, and a rather soft, thermal spectrum.},

first paper, which reported on the persistent soft X-ray emission and
the wide-band spectrum of an intense short burst, this paper presents an
analysis of the persistent broadband (1-70 keV) spectra of this source
in outburst, taken with the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) and the
Hard X-ray Detector (HXD). Pulse-phase folding in the 12-35 keV HXD-PIN
data on an ephemeris based on multi-satellite timing measurements at
soft X-rays revealed the pulsed signals at gsim99\% confidence in the
hard X-ray band. The wide-band spectrum clearly consists of a soft
component and a separate hard component, crossing over at {\textasciitilde}7 keV. When
the soft component is modeled by a blackbody plus a Comptonized
blackbody, the hard component exhibits a 20-100 keV flux of
4.8+0.8 -0.6(stat.)+0.8

{\textgreater}10 keV up to at least \~{}110 keV, with an even higher flux of
1.3 {\texttimes} 10-10erg cm-2s-1 in 20-100
keV. The pulsation was detected at least up to 70 keV for a period of
2.072135{\textpm}0.00005 s, with a deeper modulation than was measured in
a fainter state. The phase-averaged 0.7-114 keV spectrum was reproduced
by an absorbed blackbody emission with a temperature of 0.65{\textpm}0.02
keV, plus a hard power-law with a photon index of \~{}1.5. At a
distance of 9 kpc, the bolometric luminosity of the blackbody and the
2-100 keV luminosity of the hard power-law are estimated to be
(6.2{\textpm}1.2) {\texttimes} 1035erg s-1 and 1.9
{\texttimes} 1036erg s-1, respectively, while the
blackbody radius becomes \~{}5 km. Although the source has not been
detected significantly in hard X-rays during the past fainter states, a
comparison of the present and past spectra at energies below 10 keV
suggests that the hard component is more enhanced than the soft X-ray
component during the period of persistent activity.},

@article{goldreich_magnetic_1992,
	Abstract = {Three mechanisms that promote the loss of magnetic flux from an isolated neutron star - Ohmic decay, ambipolar diffusion, and Hall drift - are investigated. Equations of motions are solved for charged particles in the presence of a magnetic field and a fixed background of neutrons, while allowing for the creation and destruction of particles by weak interactions. Although these equations apply to normal neutrons and protons, the present interpretations of their solutions are extended to cover cases of neutron superfluidity and proton superconductivity. The equations are manipulated to prove that, in the presence of a magnetic force, the charged particles cannot be simultaneously in magnetostatic equilibrium and chemical equilibrium with the neutrons. The application of the results to real neutron stars is discussed.},

@article{lyutikov_magnetar_2006,
	Abstract = {We propose that giant flares on soft $\gamma$-ray repeaters produce relativistic, strongly magnetized, weakly baryon-loaded magnetic clouds, somewhat analogous to solar coronal mass ejection (CME) events. The flares are driven by unwinding of the internal non-potential magnetic field which leads to a slow build-up of magnetic energy outside of the neutron star. For large magnetospheric currents, corresponding to a large twist of the external magnetic field, the magnetosphere becomes dynamically unstable on the Alfv{\'e}n crossing time-scale of the
inner magnetosphere, tA{\textasciitilde}RNS/c{\textasciitilde} 30$\mu$s. The
dynamic instability leads to the formation of dissipative current sheets through the development of a tearing mode. The released magnetic energy results in the formation of a strongly magnetized, pair-loaded,
quasi-spherically expanding flux rope, topologically connected by the magnetic field to the neutron star during the prompt flare emission. The expansion reaches large Lorentz factors, $\Gamma${\textasciitilde} 10-20, at distances r{\textasciitilde} 1-2 {\texttimes} 107cm, where a leptophotonic load is lost. Beyond this radius plasma is strongly dominated by the magnetic field, though some baryon loading, with M{\textless}2, by ablated neutron star material may occur. Magnetic stresses of the tied flux rope lead to a late collimation of the expansion, on time-scales longer than the giant flare duration. Relativistic bulk motion of the expanding magnetic cloud, directed at an angle $\theta${\textasciitilde} 135{\textdegree} to the line of sight
(away from the observer), results in a strongly non-spherical forward shock with observed non-relativistic apparent expansion and bulk motion velocities $\beta$app{\textasciitilde} cot $\theta$/2 {\textasciitilde} 0.4 at times of the
first radio observations, approximately one week after the burst. An interaction with a shell of wind-shocked interstellar medium (ISM) and then with the unshocked ISM leads to a deceleration, to non-relativistic velocities approximately one month after the flare.},

@article{kalapotharakos_gamma-ray_2014,
	Abstract = {We compute the patterns of $\gamma$-ray emission due to curvature
radiation in dissipative pulsar magnetospheres. Our ultimate goal is to
construct macrophysical models that are able to reproduce the observed
$\gamma$-ray light curve phenomenology recently published in the Second
Fermi Pulsar Catalog. We apply specific forms of Ohm's law on the open
field lines using a broad range for the macroscopic conductivity values
that result in solutions ranging, from near-vacuum to near-force-free.
Using these solutions, we generate model $\gamma$-ray light curves by
calculating realistic trajectories and Lorentz factors of radiating
particles under the influence of both the accelerating electric fields
and curvature radiation reaction. We further constrain our models using
the observed dependence of the phase lags between the radio and
$\gamma$-ray emission on the $\gamma$-ray peak separation. We perform a
statistical comparison of our model radio-lag versus peak-separation
diagram and the one obtained for the Fermi standard pulsars. We find
that for models of uniform conductivity over the entire open magnetic
field line region, agreement with observations favors higher values of
this parameter. We find, however, significant improvement in fitting the
data with models that employ a hybrid form of conductivity,
specifically, infinite conductivity interior to the light cylinder and
high but finite conductivity on the outside. In these models the
$\gamma$-ray emission is produced in regions near the equatorial current
sheet but modulated by the local physical properties. These models have
radio lags near the observed values and statistically best reproduce the
observed light curve phenomenology. Additionally, they also produce GeV
photon cut-off energies.},
